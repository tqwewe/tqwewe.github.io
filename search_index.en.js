Why Build a Custom Event Store?\nEvent sourcing revolves around capturing changes to an application’s state as a sequence of immutable events. While it’s possible to use off-the-shelf databases like Postgres or traditional event stores for this, they aren’t naturally optimized for an append-only flow. That’s where Eventus comes in. By designing a store specifically for event sourcing, we can optimize for writes and simplify the process of retrieving events in sequence.\nThe core challenge with conventional databases is that they’re built for more general CRUD-like operations, where records are added, updated, or removed frequently. In event sourcing, data is never actually overwritten; events are recorded in the order they occur. This is inherently sequential, so a specialized database can take advantage of predictable I/O patterns to deliver more consistent performance, even when data volumes grow large.\nEventus at a Glance: Inspiration and Core Goals\nEventus was built from a desire to have a lean, high-performance event store that exploits the sequential and immutable nature of event sourcing. Many existing solutions rely on general-purpose databases or are tightly coupled to languages like C# or Java. Eventus takes a more minimalistic approach:\n\nIt stores and indexes events as they come in, without the overhead of features not needed in an event-sourcing model.\nIt aims for constant-time writes (O(1)) by appending data in segmented files.\nIt maintains simpler, more direct indexing for retrieving events by global ID or stream ID.\n\nBy focusing on event sourcing rather than broader use cases, Eventus avoids the complexity found in traditional relational databases or fully-fledged event store products that may include extra functionalities you don’t necessarily need.\nWhy Rust? Performance and Safety Benefits\nRust provides a set of features that make it uniquely suitable for building databases. First, it offers memory safety without a garbage collector, which helps avoid many concurrency pitfalls and performance penalties. Rust’s zero-cost abstractions let you write low-level, high-performance code while maintaining a clean, maintainable architecture. This is crucial when dealing with large-scale read and write operations, where even small inefficiencies can add up quickly.\nMoreover, Rust’s ecosystem includes libraries for serialization (like MessagePack), concurrency, and networking (for the optional gRPC layer), making it an excellent toolchain for building a modern database from the ground up.\nCore Architecture: Segmented Files, Global Index, and Stream Index\nEventus’s architecture is guided by a very straightforward principle: store events sequentially and track them with lightweight indexes. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nSegmented Files\n\nEach file, or “segment,” can contain up to 256,000 events. When one segment fills up, Eventus rolls over to a new segment. This segmentation keeps file sizes predictable and simplifies certain maintenance tasks (like re-indexing).\n\n\nGlobal Index \n\nAlongside each segment is a global index file. It contains pairs of (offset, position) for every event in that segment. This lets you quickly jump to the event data in the segment file without scanning through each record.\n\n\nStream Index\n\nEach segment also has a stream index, which uses a fixed-size hashmap on disk to associate stream IDs with a list of event IDs. This allows efficient retrieval of all events belonging to a given stream, again without needing a full scan.\n\n\nBy separating the data layer (the .events file) from the indexing layers, Eventus can be more resilient if an index becomes corrupted or needs to be rebuilt. The segmented approach also means writes remain constant-time, as each new event is appended at the end.\nData Format and Serialization Details\nEvery event is written in a compact binary format:\nBytesEncodingField\n0-7Little Endian u64Offset\n8-11Little Endian u32Payload Size\n12-15Little Endian u32CRC32C\n16-17Little Endian u16Record Type\n18-25Little Endian u64TransactionID\n26+BytesPayload\n\nInside the Payload section, Eventus uses MessagePack to serialize an Event struct that includes fields like event ID, stream ID, event name, and metadata. This structure keeps the core data needed for event sourcing small and quickly readable.\nReliability: Rehydration, CRC Checks, and Single-Writer Approach\nOne of the biggest concerns for any database is ensuring data integrity. In Eventus, CRC32C checks are used to verify the integrity of each event on disk. If a file becomes corrupted, the software can detect it as soon as it attempts to read the affected event.\nFirst-Class Transactions\nEventus treats transactions as first-class citizens, ensuring that every event or group of events is part of a transaction. Each event message is associated with a transaction_id (a u64), which uniquely identifies the transaction it belongs to. Here's how transactions are managed:\n\n\nTransaction Association: Every event is tagged with a transaction_id. This allows Eventus to group related events together, ensuring they are processed atomically.\n\n\nCommit Markers: After a transaction is committed, a special commit message with the same transaction_id but no payload is written to the event store. This commit marker signifies that all events associated with that transaction are finalized and should be considered valid.\n\n\nHandling Uncommitted Events: Any events that are read which are not committed (events not followed by a commit message with that transaction) will simply be ignored and considered uncommitted. In practice however, uncommited events would never typically be even written to in the first place.\n\n\nRehydration and Single-Writer Approach\nEventus uses rehydration at startup to rebuild its index files if they’re missing or out of date. This is possible because the underlying .events file is the single source of truth—its immutable sequence of events can always be scanned.\nAdditionally, Eventus adopts a single-writer approach for appending new events. This design simplifies concurrency control, removes the need for complex locking, and guarantees events remain in the correct order as they arrive.\nBy integrating transactions directly into the event handling process, Eventus ensures that the event store remains consistent and reliable, even in the face of failures or unexpected interruptions.\nPerformance: O(1) Writes and Scalable Reads\nBy writing events in an append-only fashion, Eventus ensures that each new event is appended to the tail of the current segment. The index files are updated accordingly right after the event is written. This mechanism allows writes to remain O(1)—they don’t slow down as data grows, because no large-scale rearranging or row locks are required.\nRead operations benefit from the streamlined indexes:\n\nThe global index points you directly to an event offset.\nThe stream index quickly returns all event IDs for any given stream.\n\nIn systems where reads can be further optimized with caching or partial in-memory indexes, this approach provides enough flexibility to scale while keeping the core logic simple.\nCurrent State and Real-World Use Cases\nAlthough Eventus hasn’t officially launched yet, it’s already powering a startup I’ve been building, serving as the backbone for a high-throughput event-sourced application. Because it focuses on essential event-store features—fast writes, sequential storage, and efficient indexing—Eventus fits nicely into any system where append-only data is key. Teams that prioritize Rust’s performance, or those seeking an alternative to C#/Java-based solutions, may find Eventus especially compelling.\nRoadmap: Horizontal Scaling, Monitoring, and More\nEventus is still growing, with exciting plans for the future:\n\n\nHorizontal Scalability\nDistributing writes across multiple nodes is a challenging undertaking, but it would open up new levels of throughput and fault tolerance.\n\n\nMonitoring and Queryability\nBuilding a foreign data wrapper or integration with tools like Supabase could make it easier to query events directly and monitor database health in real time.\n\n\nBackup and Archival Strategies\nAs more features are added, handling older segments through compression or off-site storage will become a priority.\n\n\nFor now, the focus remains on strong single-node performance and reliability.\nConclusion: Next Steps and Final Thoughts\nEventus was born out of a need for a specialized, Rust-powered event store that embraces immutability and sequential data. By focusing on the essentials—segmented storage, efficient indexing, and O(1) writes—Eventus offers a lean alternative to more bloated or general-purpose databases. Its Rust foundation delivers both performance and reliability, making it an attractive option for developers prioritizing these aspects.\nCurrently, Eventus is available on GitHub. While it’s a robust and stable solution, it comes with pretty much zero documentation. This is something I'd love to improve given free time, and I welcome any feedback or contributions from the community to help build out comprehensive guides and examples.\nWith future improvements like horizontal scaling on the horizon, there’s plenty of potential for expansion. If you’re building event-sourced systems and want a performance-oriented approach with a Rust backbone, Eventus might be worth keeping on your radar.

We'll keep things as simple as possible, and build our app using a single Task aggregate with three basic events: TaskCreated, TaskAssigned, TaskCompleted.\nThis guide assumes a basic understanding of Rust, and event sourcing, and is focused on showing how to use SierraDB as an event store.\nInitializing SierraDB\nSierraDB can be ran locally with docker:\ndocker run -p 9090:9090 tqwewe/sierradb\n\nSierraDB uses the Redis RESP3 protocol, which means you can use standard Redis clients to interact with it. This makes integration straightforward, as you'll see shortly.\nProject Setup\nLet's start by creating a new Rust project. We'll build this in three progressive steps, each adding more functionality. For our first step, create a new project:\ncargo new task-app\ncd task-app\n\nAdd the initial dependency to Cargo.toml:\n[dependencies]\nanyhow = \"1.0\"\n\nAs we progress through the tutorial, we'll add more dependencies for async operations and SierraDB integration.\nPart 1: Defining the Aggregate\nIn event sourcing, an aggregate is an entity that maintains its state by applying events. The aggregate ensures consistency and encapsulates business logic. Let's define our Task aggregate.\nThe Task Struct\nOur Task aggregate tracks the state of a single task:\n#[derive(Default)]\npub struct Task {\n    pub id: u32,\n\n    // State\n    pub created: bool,\n    pub title: String,\n    pub assigned_to: Option&lt;String&gt;,\n    pub completed: bool,\n}\n\nimpl Task {\n    pub fn new(id: u32) -&gt; Self {\n        Task {\n            id,\n            ..Default::default()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe aggregate holds the current state of the task - whether it's been created, who it's assigned to, and whether it's completed.\nDefining Events\nEvents represent things that have happened to the task. Each event is immutable and describes a state change:\npub enum TaskEvent {\n    TaskCreated { title: String },\n    TaskAssigned { assignee: String },\n    TaskCompleted {},\n}\n\nCommands and Validation\nCommands validate the current state and generate events. They enforce business rules without directly mutating state:\nimpl Task {\n    pub fn create(&amp;self, title: String) -&gt; Result&lt;TaskEvent&gt; {\n        if self.created {\n            bail!(\"task already created\");\n        }\n\n        Ok(TaskEvent::TaskCreated { title })\n    }\n\n    pub fn assign(&amp;self, assignee: String) -&gt; Result&lt;TaskEvent&gt; {\n        if self.assigned_to.as_ref() == Some(&amp;assignee) {\n            bail!(\"task already assigned to {assignee}\");\n        }\n\n        Ok(TaskEvent::TaskAssigned { assignee })\n    }\n\n    pub fn complete(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;TaskEvent&gt; {\n        if self.completed {\n            bail!(\"task already completed\");\n        }\n\n        Ok(TaskEvent::TaskCompleted {})\n    }\n}\n\nEach command checks if the operation is valid given the current state. If valid, it returns an event; otherwise, it returns an error.\nApplying Events\nThe apply method is where state mutations happen. It takes an event and updates the aggregate's state accordingly:\nimpl Task {\n    pub fn apply(&amp;mut self, event: TaskEvent) {\n        use TaskEvent::*;\n\n        match event {\n            TaskCreated { title } =&gt; {\n                self.created = true;\n                self.title = title;\n            }\n            TaskAssigned { assignee } =&gt; {\n                self.assigned_to = Some(assignee);\n            }\n            TaskCompleted {} =&gt; {\n                self.completed = true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis separation between commands (which validate) and apply (which mutates) is a key pattern in event sourcing. Commands can fail, but applying events never does - events represent facts that have already occurred.\nTesting the Pattern\nHere's how you use the aggregate:\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let mut task = Task::new(0);\n\n    // Create the task\n    let event = task.create(\"My Board\".to_string())?;\n    task.apply(event);\n\n    // Assign the task\n    let event = task.assign(\"tqwewe\".to_string())?;\n    task.apply(event);\n\n    // Mark task as completed\n    let event = task.complete()?;\n    task.apply(event);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nAt this point, our events are only stored in memory. Let's fix that by persisting them to SierraDB.\nPart 2: Persisting Events\nNow we'll extend our aggregate to persist events to SierraDB. This involves connecting to the database and using the EAPPEND command to append events to a stream.\nAdding Dependencies\nUpdate your Cargo.toml to include async and database dependencies:\n[dependencies]\nanyhow = \"1.0\"\nredis = \"0.32\"\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\nserde_json = \"1.0\"\nsierradb-client = \"0.1\"\ntokio = { version = \"1.48\", features = [\"full\"] }\n\nVersioning and Optimistic Locking\nIn a distributed system, multiple processes might try to modify the same aggregate concurrently. SierraDB uses optimistic locking with version numbers to handle this. We add a version field to track the aggregate's current version:\nuse sierradb_client::CurrentVersion;\n\n#[derive(Default)]\npub struct Task {\n    pub id: u32,\n    pub version: CurrentVersion, // Added for concurrency control\n\n    // State (unchanged)\n    pub created: bool,\n    // ... rest of fields\n}\n\nCurrentVersion is an enum from the SierraDB client that represents either an initial state or a specific version number. It provides methods like next() to calculate the expected version for the next event.\nUpdating the Apply Method\nWe modify apply to track versions and ensure events are applied sequentially:\npub fn apply(&amp;mut self, event: TaskEvent, version: u64) {\n    use TaskEvent::*;\n\n    assert_eq!(\n        self.version.next(),\n        version,\n        \"versions should be sequential\"\n    );\n    self.version = CurrentVersion::Current(version);\n\n    // Match statement unchanged\n    match event {\n        // ... same as before\n    }\n}\n\nThis ensures that events are applied in the correct order and prevents version conflicts.\nSerializing Events\nEvents need to be serialized for storage. We add Serialize to TaskEvent and create a method to extract event names:\nuse serde::Serialize;\n\n#[derive(Serialize)]\npub enum TaskEvent {\n    TaskCreated { /* ... */ },\n    TaskAssigned { /* ... */ },\n    TaskCompleted {},\n}\n\nimpl TaskEvent {\n    pub fn name(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;'static str {\n        use TaskEvent::*;\n        match self {\n            TaskCreated { .. } =&gt; \"TaskCreated\",\n            TaskAssigned { .. } =&gt; \"TaskAssigned\",\n            TaskCompleted { .. } =&gt; \"TaskCompleted\",\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSierraDB stores the event name separately from the payload, which allows for efficient querying and filtering by event type.\nThe Append Method\nHere's where we actually persist events to SierraDB:\nuse redis::aio::MultiplexedConnection;\nuse sierradb_client::{AppendInfo, AsyncTypedCommands, EAppendOptions};\n\nimpl Task {\n    pub fn stream_id(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"task-{}\", self.id)\n    }\n\n    pub async fn append(&amp;self, conn: &amp;mut MultiplexedConnection, event: &amp;TaskEvent) -&gt; Result&lt;AppendInfo&gt; {\n        let payload = serde_json::to_vec(event)?;\n        let opts = EAppendOptions::new()\n            .expected_version(self.version.as_expected_version())\n            .payload(payload);\n        let append = conn.eappend(self.stream_id(), event.name(), opts).await?;\n\n        Ok(append)\n    }\n}\n\nLet's break this down:\n\nStream ID: Each aggregate gets its own event stream. We use task-{id} as the stream identifier\nEAPPEND: The SierraDB command for appending events. It takes the stream ID, event name, and options\nExpected Version: This is the key to optimistic locking. We tell SierraDB what version we expect the stream to be at. If another process has modified the stream, our append will fail\nPayload: The serialized event data in JSON format\n\nConnecting and Using the Database\nNow we can connect to SierraDB and persist events:\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let client = redis::Client::open(\"redis://127.0.0.1:9090?protocol=resp3\")?;\n    let mut conn = client.get_multiplexed_async_connection().await?;\n\n    let mut task = Task::new(0);\n\n    // Create the task\n    let event = task.create(\"My Board\".to_string())?;\n    let append = task.append(&amp;mut conn, &amp;event).await?; // Persist to SierraDB\n    task.apply(event, append.stream_version);           // Update in-memory state\n\n    // Assign the task\n    let event = task.assign(\"tqwewe\".to_string())?;\n    let append = task.append(&amp;mut conn, &amp;event).await?;\n    task.apply(event, append.stream_version);\n\n    // Mark task as completed\n    let event = task.complete()?;\n    let append = task.append(&amp;mut conn, &amp;event).await?;\n    task.apply(event, append.stream_version);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nNote the workflow: validate → append → apply. We first validate and create the event, then persist it, then apply it to our in-memory state. The stream version from each append is passed into the apply methods so the aggregate instance will store the correct version.\nInspecting Events\nYou can use redis-cli to inspect the events stored in SierraDB:\nredis-cli -p 9090\n127.0.0.1:9090&gt; ESCAN task-0 - +\n\nThis shows all events with their metadata, including transaction IDs, timestamps, stream versions, and payloads. The - means \"start from the beginning\" and + means \"to the end\".\nAlternatively, you can use sierradb-inspector to view events through the Web UI.\ndocker run -p 3001:3001 --network host -e SIERRADB_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:9090 tqwewe/sierradb-inspector\n\nAnd visit http://localhost:3001/streams?streamId=task-0 in your browser.\n\nPart 3: Loading Aggregate State\nThe real power of event sourcing is that you can rebuild an aggregate's state by replaying its events. Let's implement a load method to reconstruct a task from its event stream.\nAdding Deserialization\nFirst, add Deserialize to TaskEvent:\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]\npub enum TaskEvent {\n    // ... unchanged\n}\n\nThe Load Method\nHere's how we load and rebuild an aggregate:\nimpl Task {\n    pub async fn load(&amp;mut self, conn: &amp;mut MultiplexedConnection) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n        let stream_id = self.stream_id();\n\n        loop {\n            // Load events in batches of 100\n            let batch = conn\n                .escan(&amp;stream_id, self.version.next(), None, Some(100))\n                .await?;\n\n            // Apply the events to the Task aggregate\n            for event in batch.events {\n                let task_event = serde_json::from_slice(&amp;event.payload)?;\n                self.apply(task_event, event.stream_version);\n            }\n\n            // If there's no more events, break\n            if !batch.has_more {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nThis method:\n\nUses ESCAN to read events from SierraDB in batches\nDeserializes each event from JSON\nApplies each event in order, rebuilding the state\nContinues until all events have been processed\n\nThe batching is important for performance with large event streams. SierraDB's has_more flag tells us when we've read all events.\nComplete Event Sourcing Cycle\nNow we can demonstrate the full cycle - persist events, then load them back:\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let client = redis::Client::open(\"redis://127.0.0.1:9090?protocol=resp3\")?;\n    let mut conn = client.get_multiplexed_async_connection().await?;\n\n    let mut task = Task::new(0);\n    task.load(&amp;mut conn).await?;\n\n    // Create and persist events\n    let event = task.create(\"My Board\".to_string())?;\n    let append = task.append(&amp;mut conn, &amp;event).await?;\n    task.apply(event, append.stream_version);\n\n    let event = task.assign(\"tqwewe\".to_string())?;\n    let append = task.append(&amp;mut conn, &amp;event).await?;\n    task.apply(event, append.stream_version);\n\n    let event = task.complete()?;\n    let append = task.append(&amp;mut conn, &amp;event).await?;\n    task.apply(event, append.stream_version);\n\n    // Load the task again from events\n    let mut task2 = Task::new(0);\n    task2.load(&amp;mut conn).await?;\n    assert_eq!(\n        task2.version,\n        CurrentVersion::Current(2),\n        \"Loaded task should have the correct version\"\n    );\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nThe assertion verifies that the loaded task has the correct version, proving that all events were successfully replayed.\nConclusion\nWe've built a working event-sourcing application in Rust with SierraDB! Let's recap what we covered:\n\nDefined an aggregate with clear separation between commands (validation) and apply (mutation)\nPersisted events to SierraDB using the EAPPEND command with optimistic locking\nLoaded aggregate state by replaying events from the event store using ESCAN\n\nThis foundation gives you everything you need to build event-sourced applications. Some next steps you might explore:\n\nSubscriptions: Listen to event streams in real-time as new events are appended\nProjections: Build read models by subscribing to events and maintaining denormalized views\nSnapshots: Optimize loading by creating periodic snapshots of aggregate state\nSagas: Coordinate multiple aggregates with long-running business processes\n\nFor more information about SierraDB's features and API, check out the documentation at sierradb.io.\nProduction-Ready Event Sourcing\nWhile this blog post demonstrates event sourcing concepts step by step, real-world applications require additional features like command routing, automatic conflict resolution, aggregate caching, and more sophisticated error handling.\nFor production Rust applications, consider using kameo_es - a comprehensive event sourcing framework that provides:\n\nTraits to implement for aggregates and commands\nAutomatic command execution with validation\nEvent appending with retry logic on conflicts\nAggregate caching for improved performance\nBuilt-in patterns for subscriptions and projections\n\nThis blog post keeps things simple to focus on the core concepts, but kameo_es handles the complexity of production event sourcing applications.\n\nClick to see the same Task aggregate implemented with kameo_es\nuse anyhow::{bail, Result};\nuse kameo_es::{\n    command_service::{CommandService, ExecuteExt},\n    Apply, Command, CommandName, Context, Entity, EventType, Metadata,\n};\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\nuse sierradb_client::ExpectedVersion;\n\n#[derive(Clone, Default)]\npub struct Task {\n    pub created: bool,\n    pub title: String,\n    pub assigned_to: Option&lt;String&gt;,\n    pub completed: bool,\n}\n\nimpl Entity for Task {\n    type ID = u32;\n    type Event = TaskEvent;\n    type Metadata = ();\n\n    fn category() -&gt;

Event sourcing is a niche, yet important pattern in software development. Despite this, there's absolutely no clear cut way of approaching it for new projects, especially when it comes to how and where events are stored. Some advise using existing general purpose databases such as Postgres, or even Kafka. However, event sourcing has specific requirements that make general-purpose databases either overkill or missing key features.\nThis gap in the domain of event sourcing specific databases is what led me to build SierraDB, a horizontally scalable database built from the ground up in Rust.\nThe Problem with Event Sourcing Databases\nOn the spectrum of storage solutions, purpose built event sourcing databases can be counted on one hand. These include Kurrent (formerly EventStoreDB), AxonServer, and some other solutions built on top of Postgres. However, the former two databases built from the ground up are built in garbage collected languages, which, in my view, are suboptimal for building high-performance databases.\nEvent sourcing demands specific guarantees that general purpose databases struggle with: truly append-only storage, gapless sequence numbers, efficient stream reading, and built-in subscriptions for projections. You either end up fighting your database to maintain these invariants, or you accept a solution that wasn't designed with performance as a first-class concern.\nSierraDB takes inspiration from Cassandra in regards to its scalability and partitioning, and AxonServer with its segmented append-only file structure - but reimagined in Rust for predictable performance and without the overhead of garbage collection.\nWhy SierraDB?\nSierraDB addresses specific gaps in the event sourcing database landscape.\nRust provides predictable performance without garbage collection pauses - important when you need consistent latencies. Memory safety without runtime overhead means fewer surprises in production.\nUsing RESP3 means no custom drivers needed. Every language with a Redis client works immediately. You can even use redis-cli to explore your event store, making debugging and development straightforward.\nThe partition model supports horizontal scaling from the start. Begin with a single node and 32 partitions, scale to hundreds of nodes with 1024+ partitions. Replication and consensus aren't bolted-on features - they're core to the design.\nSubscriptions are built into the protocol. Event sourcing isn't just about storing events - projections and event handlers need to stay in sync with the event log. SierraDB can stream events from any point in history, making this simple to implement.\nCore Architecture: Partitions, Buckets, and Segments\nSierraDB stores events into a fixed number of logical partitions within a cluster. This is decided when initialising your database, and may be set to 32 partitions for a single node setup, or 1024 for a setup with many nodes.\nThe number of partitions is crucial: each partition processes writes sequentially, giving us gapless monotonic sequence numbers. This means your partition count is effectively your maximum concurrency for writes - 32 partitions means up to 32 concurrent write streams. But more isn't always better. Event handlers need to track their position per partition, so too many partitions adds overhead for consumers. It's a balance between write throughput and consumer complexity.\nEach node in a cluster stores events in append-only files belonging to buckets. The number of buckets is typically divisible by the number of partitions. For example, 32 partitions, and 4 buckets = each bucket stores 8 partitions. Each bucket writes 256MB segment files, rolling over to a new one once the previous fills. This gives us immutable data, allowing segments to be indexed once and cached forever, without the file size growing indefinitely.\nThe data directory of a node might look like this:\ndata/\n  buckets/\n    00000/\n      segments/\n        0000000000/\n          data.evts      # Raw append-only event data\n          index.eidx     # Event ID index (lookup event by ID)\n          partition.pidx # Partition index (scan events by partition ID)\n          stream.sidx    # Stream index (scan events by stream ID)\n        0000000001/...\n    00001/...\n    00002/...\n    00003/...\n\nThe Version Guarantee: Getting Ordering Right\nEvent sourcing has one non-negotiable requirement: stream version numbers. Every event within a stream gets a monotonically incrementing number starting from 0, with no gaps. Version 0, 1, 2, 3 - never 0, 1, 3, 4.\nThis guarantee enables optimistic locking: when appending events, you specify the expected version. If another process wrote to that stream since you last read it, the append fails and you retry. It's non-blocking concurrency control, but it requires absolute certainty that missing a version means a conflict, not data loss. A gap in versions would be catastrophic - it would mean lost events.\nWhy not use a global sequence number? Some databases do this, but it becomes a bottleneck in distributed systems. Every write would need to coordinate through a single counter. SierraDB takes a different approach: each partition has its own monotonic, gapless sequence number. Partitions progress independently, giving you the ordering guarantees you need without the coordination overhead. Event handlers simply track which sequence they've processed per partition, rather than maintaining a single global position. This also enables parallel event handling by consumers.\nCross-stream transactions through shared partition keys. Streams in SierraDB are mapped to partitions using a partition key - by default, a UUIDv5 derived from the stream ID. But here's the key insight: you can give multiple streams the same partition key. When a user-123 stream and an account-456 stream share a partition key, they're guaranteed to live in the same partition. This means you can atomically append events to both streams in a single transaction, without distributed coordination. The partition key acts as a correlation ID, letting you group related streams that need transactional consistency.\nDistributed Consensus Without the Complexity\nRunning a cluster of nodes in SierraDB gives us redundancy through replication. Each partition is replicated across multiple nodes based on your replication factor - if you set it to 3, every event lives on 3 different nodes. All writes require majority quorum (2 out of 3 nodes majority agreement) before being considered successful, ensuring durability even if a node fails.\nHere's where SierraDB diverges from traditional distributed databases: reads don't require quorum. Instead, each event stores a confirmation count in its metadata. When a write achieves quorum, a background process broadcasts this confirmation to all replicas, updating their local confirmation counts. This means any single node can serve consistent reads without network round-trips - a massive performance win.\nBut distributed systems are messy. Writes can complete out of order, network messages can be delayed, and confirmations might arrive in any sequence. Imagine partition sequence 100 is confirmed, but 99 is still pending - reading up to 100 would create a gap, breaking our guarantee.\nThis is where the watermark system comes in. Each partition tracks its \"highest continuously confirmed sequence\" - essentially, how far we can read without hitting a gap. If sequences 1-98 and 100-102 are confirmed, the watermark stays at 98. Once 99 confirms, it jumps to 102. Readers only see events up to the watermark, guaranteeing they always get a consistent, gap-free view of the partition.\nSequences:  96   97   98 | 99   100  101  102\nState 1:    ✓    ✓    ✓  | ?    ✓    ✓    ✓     ← Watermark at 98\n                         └─ gap prevents reading beyond 98\n\nState 2:    ✓    ✓    ✓    ✓    ✓    ✓    ✓     ← Watermark at 102\n                                              └─ continuous, can read all\n\nFor leadership and coordination, SierraDB uses term-based consensus inspired by Raft. Each partition has a leader node that coordinates writes, with automatic failover if the leader becomes unavailable. But unlike full Raft, we use deterministic leader selection based on the cluster topology - no expensive elections needed.\n\nHere's a detailed diagram of the three-phase write protocol within SierraDB.\n\n\nStanding on Giants' Shoulders\nThe chosen protocol for communicating with the database is Redis' RESP3. It's modern, simple, and most importantly - battle-tested. Every language has a Redis client, which means SierraDB works out of the box with existing libraries. No custom drivers needed. You can even use redis-cli to explore your event store, making debugging and development remarkably straightforward.\nFor inter-node communication, SierraDB uses libp2p - the same networking stack that powers IPFS and other distributed systems. It handles the complexity of peer discovery, connection management, and provides gossip protocol for topology management. Nodes can find each other, share cluster state, and route messages without requiring static configuration or service discovery.\nThe networking layer is built with Kameo, an actor framework I wrote for building fault-tolerant distributed systems in Rust. Actors provide isolated units of computation that communicate through message passing - perfect for handling concurrent operations in a distributed database. Each partition leader, replication coordinator, and background process runs as a supervised actor. If one crashes, it's automatically restarted without affecting the rest of the system. Kameo itself is built on libp2p, so the entire networking stack shares the same foundation.\nThese aren't arbitrary choices. RESP3 gives us immediate ecosystem compatibility. libp2p provides production-proven p2p networking. And actors give us fault isolation and supervision trees that make the system resilient to partial failures - critical properties for a database that needs to keep running when things go wrong.\nMaking It Usable\nGetting a database to a stage where it's useful for others takes far more work than building a proof-of-concept. With RESP3 being used for commands, names had to be chosen which don't conflict with existing Redis commands, which is why all SierraDB commands are prefixed with E (EAPPEND, ESCAN, ESUB, etc).\nSince this database is purpose built for event sourcing, first-class support for subscriptions was a priority. Clients can subscribe to all or specific partitions, starting from specific partition sequences, and SierraDB streams all historical events from the specified sequences, plus any new events appended afterward. This makes building projections and event handlers straightforward - no polling needed, no complex catch-up logic.\nFor Rust applications, kameo_es provides traits and types for defining aggregates and executing commands that persist to SierraDB - handling much of the domain modeling boilerplate.\nDatabase observability is crucial, especially for event sourcing where one of the huge benefits is seeing why events occurred. For this, SierraDB Inspector was built - a web interface for exploring events and running projections with JavaScript. Being able to quickly query and visualize your event streams makes debugging significantly easier.\n\nScreenshots of SierraDB Inspector web interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, getting started should be frictionless. Docker images are available on DockerHub, with one-liners to get up and running.\nCurrent State, Lessons Learned, and What's Next\nSierraDB runs stably under long-running stress tests, with major corruption issues ironed out. The core architecture — partitions, streams, subscriptions, RESP3 — feels right and stable. While performance still has room to grow, the foundation is solid. The design decisions are the result of years of trial and error from different approaches to building event sourcing systems.\nMy goal is to evolve SierraDB into a production-ready, open-source event store that scales with modern workloads — and I’d love help getting there. Docs and tests are still early, so contributions are incredibly welcome.\nTry It Out\ndocker run -p 9090:9090 tqwewe/sierradb\nredis-cli -p 9090\n&gt; EAPPEND user-123 UserCreated '{\"name\": \"Alice\"}'\n&gt; ESCAN user-123 - +\n\n\nSierraDB Github Repository\nSierraDB Inspector\nSierraDB Github Org\nPersonal Github Profile\n\n","id":"https://tqwewe.com/blog/building-sierradb/","title":"SierraDB: A Distributed Event Store Built in Rust"},"https://tqwewe.com/blog/comparing-rust-actor-libraries/":{"body":"Introduction\nRust’s actor ecosystem is flourishing with multiple libraries offering unique approaches to concurrency and distributed system design.

Here’s a concise summary:\n\nActix excels at local concurrency, offering robust documentation and fast actor creation.\nHowever its async support is an afterthought, and not the smoothest experience when compared to other actor libraries. \nCoerce is specialized for distributed systems on top of Tokio.\nKameo balances local and distributed needs with solid performance, easy-to-use APIs, and supervision built-in.\nRactor is another viable choice for distributed actor systems with a simpler design.\nHowever, it is the only library which only supports a single message type per actor, encouraging the use of enum messages, which may not be desirable for some.\nXtra provides flexible runtime options and is well-suited for projects seeking a more minimal actor framework.\n\nUltimately, the best library for your project will depend on your exact requirements.\nIf you need straightforward concurrency, Actix or Xtra might suffice. If you need built-in distribution without much extra configuration, Kameo, Coerce, or Ractor may be more appealing.\n\nAccess the Full Benchmark Suite\nAll benchmark code, configurations, and raw results are open-sourced:\n\nGitHub – tqwewe/actor-benchmarks\n\nPlease feel free to clone, run, and submit pull requests.

While Neovim has been a stalwart in the developer community for decades, Helix offers a fresh, modern approach that’s gaining traction. Let’s dive into a concise comparison to help you decide which editor aligns best with your workflow.\nBackground and Adoption\nAlthough I dabbled with Neovim in the past, it never became my primary editor despite me trying. Since early 2023, I've been using Helix exclusively, primarily for writing Rust code. The allure of terminal-based editors lies in their performance and minimalistic design, especially when contrasted with bloated GUI editors like VSCode. The multi-modal editing capabilities that both Helix and Neovim offer are a significant draw, providing a level of efficiency that many GUI counterparts lack.\nInstallation and Setup\nVim often comes pre-installed on Unix systems, making it easily accessible. For those opting for Neovim, a popular Vim fork, installation can be straightforward via package managers. However, Neovim's plethora of distributions can be overwhelming, requiring users to experiment to find the right fit.\nOn the other hand, Helix isn't typically pre-installed but can be effortlessly installed through most package managers or compiled from source using Cargo.\nSetting up Helix from source involves exporting the helix runtime, but overall, Helix’s configuration is minimalistic, requiring just a TOML file for customization.\nFor reference, my Helix config file I've settled on is 40 lines of toml. I have another guide specifically for optimizing your Helix configuration.\nUser Interface and Experience\nAt first glance, Helix and Neovim share similar interfaces. However, Neovim distributions often come heavily customized with plugins like Telescope for enhanced file navigation and search capabilities. Helix incorporates comparable features out-of-the-box, including a built-in file picker that rivals Telescope’s functionality.\nOne standout difference is Helix’s user-friendly key sequence popups, which display possible options as you begin typing a hotkey. For instance, pressing space reveals available actions like f for opening a file picker, making the editing experience more intuitive.\nIntuitiveness and Customization\nHelix has been notably more intuitive for me, primarily due to its cursor-based editing approach. Unlike Vim's verb-noun keybindings (e.g., dw for delete word), Helix follows a noun-verb pattern where you first select the text (e.g., w for word) and then perform the action (d to delete). This method feels more natural and user-friendly, especially for those new to multi-modal editing.\nCustomization in Vim is extensive, especially with Neovim, where the entire UI can be tailored using Lua scripts. In contrast, Helix offers limited customization options, focusing mainly on themes and behavioral tweaks like displaying open buffers as tabs. This simplicity ensures stability and a consistent user experience.\nFeatures and Functionality\nHelix shines with its built-in multi-cursor support, a feature that Neovim lacks without additional plugins. Multi-cursors significantly enhance productivity by allowing simultaneous edits across multiple lines or sections. Additionally, Helix's integrated key sequence popups aid in discovering and remembering keybindings.\nConversely, Neovim boasts a rich plugin ecosystem, offering endless possibilities for customization and extended functionality. While Helix doesn’t support plugins yet, its core features are robust and continually expanding.\nBoth editors handle syntax highlighting seamlessly using Tree-sitter, ensuring accurate and efficient code parsing while maintaining broad support for different languages. However, Neovim retains an edge with its native code folding capabilities, allowing developers to collapse and expand code blocks easily.\nPerformance and Efficiency\nIn terms of speed, both Neovim and Helix are exceptionally responsive and snappy. Vanilla Vim and Helix perform comparably, with minimal latency during editing. However, Neovim setups with numerous plugins can introduce slight delays, particularly during startup.\nResource consumption remains low for both editors, making them ideal for developers who prioritize efficiency without taxing system resources.\nLearning Curve and Community Support\nHelix is easier to learn for newcomers, thanks to its intuitive editing style and straightforward configuration. The verb-noun approach in keybindings enhances user-friendliness, allowing for a more visual-feedback based experience.\nNeovim, while powerful, comes with a steeper learning curve. Mastering its keybindings and extensive plugin configurations requires time and dedication. Fortunately, Neovim’s vast community offers a wealth of resources, tutorials, and support channels, including popular YouTube educators like @ThePrimeagen.\nHelix's community, though smaller, is growing steadily. The official documentation is comprehensive, and helpful content creators like @LukePighetti provide valuable tutorials and insights.\nPros and Cons\nHelix Pros:\n\nStability: Minimal configuration reduces potential issues, ensuring a reliable editing environment.\nBuilt-in Features: Multi-cursor support and intuitive keybindings enhance productivity without the need for plugins.\nPerformance: Lightweight and fast, offering a seamless editing experience out-of-the-box.\n\nHelix Cons:\n\nLimited Customization: Fewer customization options compared to Neovim, which might deter power users.\nNo Plugin Support: Currently lacks a plugin ecosystem, though this is in development.\n\nNeovim Pros:\n\nExtensive Plugin Ecosystem: Endless customization and functionality through plugins.\nLarge Community: Abundant resources, tutorials, and community support.\nProven Stability: Decades of development and use have made Vim a reliable tool.\n\nNeovim Cons:\n\nSteep Learning Curve: Complex keybindings and configurations can be daunting for beginners.\nPotential for Bloat: Extensive plugin use can lead to maintenance challenges and reduced performance.\n\nFuture Outlook and Recommendations\nBased on my experience, I’m committed to using Helix indefinitely. Its stability, minimal configuration, and built-in features perfectly align with my workflow, especially for Rust development. The upcoming plugin support in Helix is an exciting prospect that could bridge the gap between Helix’s simplicity and Neovim’s extensibility.\nFor beginners, I highly recommend starting with Helix. Its intuitive editing style offers a smoother transition from GUI-based editors, allowing new users to achieve productivity without the initial overwhelm. However, for those who enjoy deep customization and tinkering, Neovim remains a fantastic choice, offering unparalleled flexibility and a vibrant community.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile both Helix and Neovim are formidable text editors, your choice ultimately depends on your priorities. If you value simplicity, stability, and out-of-the-box functionality, Helix is a compelling option. Conversely, if you seek extensive customization and a vast ecosystem of plugins, Neovim remains a powerhouse worth mastering.\nEmbracing a terminal-based editor like Helix or Neovim can transform your coding experience, offering speed and efficiency that GUI editors often can't match. Whatever editor you choose, the fact you're exploring these editors is awesome, and I'm very happy terminal-based editors live on in the modern world.\n\nHelix Homepage\nHelix Github\nNeovim Homepage\nNeovim Github\n\n","id":"https://tqwewe.com/blog/helix-vs-neovim/","title":"Helix vs. Neovim: A Modern Showdown of Terminal Editors"},"https://tqwewe.com/blog/timescaledb-kubernetes/":{"body":"As with most of my devops experience, setting up TimeScaleDB on my Kubernetes cluster has been a painful process\nof trying different solutions and digging through Github issues until I succeed.\nInitially, I tried using TimeScaleDB outside Kubernetes using DigitalOcean's managed postgres database, which comes\nwith support for TSDB, with one caveat – the Apache license version of TSDB doesn't support data retention among other\nfeatures. The full list of lacking features can be found at https://docs.timescale.com/about/latest/timescaledb-editions/#feature-comparison.\nAs data retention was a requirement for my project and is only available on the community license,\nI decided to install TSDB in my existing Kubernetes cluster, and here's how I did it.\nYou Might Not Need the Community License\nIf your only reason for switching from the Apache License to the Community License is to utilize data retention in TimescaleDB, a simple cron job may suffice. Otherwise, you can skip this section.\nBy default, a TimescaleDB hypertable stores data in chunks of 7-day intervals. However, this can be configured when creating a hypertable by specifying the interval. For example:\nSELECT create_hypertable('odds', by_range('timestamp', INTERVAL '24 hours'));\n\nThis would create a hypertable with chunks of 24-hour intervals.\nUsing the pg_cron extension—which your hosting provider likely already offers—we can set up a simple cron job to manually drop chunks older than a given date.\nSELECT cron.schedule(\n  'odds-cleanup',\n  '0 0 * * *', -- every day at midnight\n  $$ SELECT drop_chunks(interval '24 hours', 'odds'); $$\n);\n\nFailures\nThe TSDB docs show a list of recommended Kubernetes operators on their docs including:\n\nStackGres\nPostgres Operator (Patroni)\nPGO\nCloudNativePG\n\nI tried all of these, having success with only one: CloudNativePG.\nStackGres and Postgres Operator both come with the apache license of TSDB. I did find a promising comment on a\nGithub issue for using the Community license of TSDB, however even after following the instructions, postgres still\ndidn't let me apply a retention policy to my hypertable, due to tsdb still using the apache license.\nCloudNativePG with TSDB (Community License)\nSetting up CloudNativePG with TimeScaleDB Community License was a lot less painful than the other options.\nInstalling CloudNativePG can be done with a one liner:\nkubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.23/releases/cnpg-1.23.2.yaml\n\nMake sure to use the latest release.\nNext, create a yaml file for your database cluster as timescaledb.yaml, using the timescaledb-postgis image:\napiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1\nkind: Cluster\nmetadata:\n  name: timescaledb\nspec:\n  instances: 1\n  imageName: ghcr.io/imusmanmalik/timescaledb-postgis:latest\n  bootstrap:\n    initdb:\n      postInitTemplateSQL:\n        - CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION postgis;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder;\n  postgresql:\n    shared_preload_libraries:\n      - timescaledb\n  storage:\n    size: 5Gi\n    # storageClass: do-block-storage # In my case, I need a custom storage class with DigitalOcean\n\nAnd finally apply this file to your cluster:\nkubectl apply -f ./timescaledb.yaml\n\nAnd that's it!\nConnecting to the Database\nYou can find the password for your database with:\nkubectl get secret timescaledb-app -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode\n\nAnd connecting to it can be done by first port forwarding your database locally:\nkubectl port-forward timescaledb-0 6432:5432\n\nReplace timescaledb-0 with the pod name of your cluster.\nFinally connect using psql:\npsql -U app -h localhost -p 6432 app\n\nBest of luck!\n","id":"https://tqwewe.com/blog/timescaledb-kubernetes/","title":"A Guide to Setting Up TimeScaleDB on Kubernetes"},"https://tqwewe.com/blog/tokio-actors/":{"body":"In this blog, we'll explore a concise approach at implementing the actor model in Rust,\nusing Tokio and a smart application of traits. The actor model revolutionizes concurrent programming by\nintroducing self-contained units that communicate via asynchronous messages, avoiding shared state's pitfalls.\nThis shift simplifies development, boosts scalability, and enhances system resilience.\nQuickstart Guide to Actors in Rust\nActors encapsulate computation and communication, functioning independently to process messages sequentially.\nThis design inherently simplifies concurrency, negating locks and traditional synchronization,\nleading to more predictable and robust systems.\nFor Rustaceans, combining Tokio with traits to craft actors not only capitalizes on Rust's type safety and\nconcurrency controls but also facilitates the development of high-performing, fault-tolerant applications.\nBuilding an Actor with Tokio\nCreating an actor in Rust involves two primary steps:\n1. Spawning a Tokio Task: Each actor lives in its tokio task, allowing concurrent execution across\navailable system threads.\n2. Handling Messages Through a Channel: Actors receive messages via a\nmpsc (multi-producer, single-consumer) channel, processing each in turn.\nHere's a quick look at what setting up an actor might involve:\nstruct CounterActor {\n    count: i32,\n}\n\nimpl CounterActor {\n    fn start(self) -&gt; mpsc::Sender&lt;i32&gt; {\n        let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::unbounded_channel();\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            while let Some(amount) = rx.recv().await {\n                self.count += amount;\n            }\n        });\n\n        tx\n    }\n}\n\nTo interact with this actor, you'd send messages using the mpsc::Sender returned by CounterActor::start.\nWondering about receiving replies? Enter the oneshot channel, perfect for single message exchanges.\nBy pairing each message with a new oneshot channel, actors can easily send responses back.\nasync fn send(tx: &amp;mpsc::Sender&lt;(i32, oneshot::Sender&lt;i32&gt;)&gt;, msg: i32) -&gt; Result&lt;i32, RecvError&gt; {\n    let (reply_tx, reply_rx) = oneshot::channel();\n    tx.send((msg, reply_tx)).await?;\n    reply_rx.await\n}\n\n// ... tokio::spawn ...\nwhile let Some((amount, reply)) = rx.recv().await {\n    self.count += amount;\n    reply.send(self.count);\n}\n\nThis setup not only facilitates efficient message passing but also ensures our actors can reply directly,\nmaking our systems more interactive and responsive.\nUpgrading to Handle Diverse Message Types\nInitially, our actor setup could only deal with i32 messages. While using an enum for different message\ntypes seems like an obvious solution, it introduces limitations, especially when involving oneshot\nchannels for responses. This method hampers the developer experience and restricts message reuse across actors.\nRust offers a more elegant solution through trait objects, enabling any type to serve as a message.\nThis approach enhances flexibility and reuse without compromising on type safety.\ntrait Message&lt;T&gt; {\n    type Reply;\n    fn handle(&amp;mut self, msg: T) -&gt; Self::Reply;\n}\n\nImplementing this trait allows any struct to become a message:\nstruct Inc { amount: i32 }\n\nimpl Message&lt;Inc&gt; for CounterActor {\n    type Reply = i32;\n    fn handle(&amp;mut self, msg: Inc) -&gt; Self::Reply {\n        self.count += msg.amount;\n        self.count\n    }\n}\n\nTransitioning to Box&lt;dyn Message&lt;Inc&gt;&gt; in our channel simplifies message handling but introduces\na challenge with Rust’s trait object restrictions regarding the Reply type. Rust wont let us use dyn Message&lt;A&gt;\nwithout specifying the Reply type in the trait with dyn Message&lt;A, Reply = ...&gt;. Additionally, the first generic\nstores the message type, when we need the actor type instead.\nWe circumvent this by introducing a DynMessage trait, converting replies into a Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;,\nsidestepping the issue:\npub(crate) trait DynMessage&lt;A&gt; {\n    fn handle_dyn(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;, state: &amp;mut A) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;;\n}\n\nimpl&lt;A: Message&lt;T&gt;, T&gt; DynMessage&lt;A&gt; for M {\n    fn handle_dyn(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;, state: &amp;mut A) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Any&gt; {\n        Box::new(state.handle(*self))\n    }\n}\n\nWith this setup, our actor can now process messages as Box&lt;dyn DynMessage&gt; and return replies as Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;,\nwhich we can downcast to the expected type:\nasync fn send&lt;A, M&gt;(\n    tx: &amp;mpsc::Sender&lt;(\n        Box&lt;dyn DynMessage&lt;A&gt;&gt;,\n        oneshot::Sender&lt;Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;&gt;\n    )&gt;,\n    msg: M\n) -&gt; Result&lt;M::Reply, RecvError&gt; {\n    let (reply_tx, reply_rx) = oneshot::channel();\n    tx.send((Box::new(msg), reply_tx)).await?;\n    let any_reply: Box&lt;dyn Any&gt; = reply_rx.await?;\n    Ok(*any_reply.downcast().unwrap()) \n}\n\n// ... tokio::spawn ...\nwhile let Some((msg, reply)) = rx.recv().await {\n    let value: Box&lt;dyn Any&gt; = msg.handle_dyn(&amp;mut self);\n    reply.send(value);\n}\n\nThis method enhances our actor model's versatility, allowing for a dynamic range of message types without\nsacrificing Rust's type safety and performance benefits.\nIntroducing Kameo: Elevating Actors in Rust\nBuilding upon the versatility and robustness of the actor model we've explored,\nKameo is our advanced Rust library designed to implement actors with an eye towards simplicity and efficiency.\nKameo encapsulates the principles discussed, extending them with a suite of polished features that cater\nto real-world application needs:\n\nAsync Support: Async code with async traits.\nLifecycle Hooks: Callbacks for managing the lifecycle of an actor.\nLinks Between Actors: Create links between actors, stopping one if another is killed.\nConcurrent Queries: Query the actor concurrently without waiting for other queries to process.\nPanic Safety: Actor panics are contained and managed, maintaining system stability.\n\nWhat sets Kameo apart is its commitment to Rust's type safety and performance, all while offering an API that\nfeels native to Rust developers.\nThere's no reliance on complex macros or obscure type gymnastics; just pure, idiomatic Rust.\nKameo's message definition and handling mirror the simplicity and power of the actor model discussed earlier.\nHere’s a sneak peek at how effortlessly you can define and interact with actors in Kameo:\n// Define the actor state\nstruct Counter {\n  count: i64,\n}\n\nimpl Actor for Counter {}\n\n// Define messages\nstruct Inc(u32);\n\nimpl Message&lt;Inc&gt; for Counter {\n    type Reply = i64;\n\n    async fn handle(&amp;mut self, msg: Inc) -&gt; Self::Reply {\n        self.count += msg.0 as i64;\n        Ok(self.count)\n    }\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), SendError&gt; {\n    let counter_ref = Counter { count: 0 }.start();\n\n    let count = counter_ref.send(Inc(10)).await?;\n    assert_eq!(count, 10);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nCheck kameo out on Github https://github.com/tqwewe/kameo, and drop a star if you've enjoyed this blog post!\nFeel free to reach out with any thoughts or feedback about this approach.\n","id":"https://tqwewe.com/blog/tokio-actors/","title":"Tokio Actors with Traits in Rust"},"https://tqwewe.com/blog/working-efficiently-as-a-digital-nomad/":{"body":"Having lived in Indonesia for 6 months, and Malaysia for 3 months, I would love to share my insight into\nhow to stay efficient with your work life.\nWhat are your requirements?\nDepending on your work, you'll have specific requirements.\nMost commonly, you'll have these few basic needs:\n\nA decent wifi connection\nPower point to charge\nA peaceful work environment (with access to coffee)\n\nWhile your Airbnb or hotel may fulfill all these needs, it can be quite difficult to get into a flow state.\nAnd who wants to stay at home while you're traveling?\nCafes\nIn Indonesia, I found a quiet cafe called Say Something Coffee.
